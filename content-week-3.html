		<h2>IL: Task 1</h2>
		<p>Applying Visual storytelling to Website Designs</p>
		<p>The overall message of the site is to educate readers on the website club penguin 		and its link to digital literacy. Users will navigate the site and explore different 		areas of digital literacy and how it links to club penguinâ€™s suer experience. Readers 		will also gain insight to why the site no longer exists. My web page will have 			recognisable characters from the original club penguin as visuals as well as easy to 		read font to allow them to understand the page easily. It will incorporate various 		kinds of media for a fun user experience on the site to avoid a dull page with many 		paragraphs. </p>

		<p> Brining together the topic of my website with the audience I can begin to build 		some objectives/ predicted outcomes from visiting my webpage. Visiting my website for 		users will bring a great sense of realisation. Having the ability to connect virtual 		expires with digital literacy will prove as a valued insight for users as they begin 		to appreciate going up in a digital landscape. The webpages audience will likely be 		in the age range of 18-29 to reflect the golfer era from when MMO games were most 		popular online.
