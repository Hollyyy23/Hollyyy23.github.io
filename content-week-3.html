		<h2>IL: Task 1</h2>
		<p>Applying Visual storytelling to Website Designs</p>
		<p>The overall message of the site is to educate readers on the website club penguin 		and its link to digital literacy. Users will navigate the site and explore different 		areas of digital literacy and how it links to club penguinâ€™s suer experience. Readers 		will also gain insight to why the site no longer exists. My web page will have 			recognisable characters from the original club penguin as visuals as well as easy to 		read font to allow them to understand the page easily. It will incorporate various 		kinds of media for a fun user experience on the site to avoid a dull page with many 		paragraphs. </p>
		</section>

		<section id="iltask2">
		<h2>IL: Task 2</h2>
		<p>Incorporate the narrative plan into your portfolio</p>
		<p>These chosen narrative points will create an overarching story for users through 		various types of media that will complement each other to make a readable, coherent 		and enjoyable page with a topic that will be tailored to its page designs for 			users.</p>
