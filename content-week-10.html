		<h2>LAB: Task 2</h2>
		<p>Looking at the EA website through the different accessibility tools used in the 		previous task it’s safe to say the website is overall accessible. The page is easily 		readable with basic white and black colour contrasts. The images display alternative 		text for those struggling to process images on their device. Looking at the POUR 		principles created by W3C we can look at how this page is considered accessible. The 		page passes as perceivable with non-text content and becomes adapted when need be. 		The page is operable, with no discomfort when navigating the page. The information is 		somewhat understandable, we have seen with the webfx tool that the page is designed 		for 17–18-year-olds language wise. This means anyone younger or older may find the 		information hard to understand and navigate through. Following these guidelines helps 		individuals with disabilities access a more inclusive and user-friendly web 			experience.</p>

		<p>For my own website with its basic design, I haven’t taken to the stages yet of 		considering accessibility with my page. I understand the importance of accessibility 		in webpages and how prioritising users’ needs when designing my page is important. As 		I further my page next semester I plan in integrating accessibility deep into my 		website. My audience is broad and so I want the users who are able to access my page 		to reflect this. I also plan on embracing different principles to guarantee a 			consistent experience across various devices.</p>

		<h2>IL: Task 1</h2>
		<p>Captions are primarily designed for viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing. They 		provide a textual representation of spoken words, as well as other relevant audio 		information such as background noises or music. Whereas subtitles are intended for 		viewers who can hear the audio but may not understand the language being spoken in 		the content. They provide a translation of the dialogue into another language.</p>

		<h2>IL: Task 3</h2>
		<p>For looking forward to MAD (B). I plan on making sure all areas of my website are 		keyboard accessible and plan on testing the navigation of my page using the tab key 		to test the visibility of my page. When it comes to designing the page appropriate 		colour contrast will be a focus and making sure I don’t rely solely on colour to 		visualise information to users. Any video I hope to provide captions and transcripts 		for videos to make my content as accessible for users, including buttons also for 		pause and stop features.</p>
