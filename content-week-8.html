</p>
		<p>The audio on this webpage is used to add an ambiance to the userâ€™s experience. The music is relaxing with an explorative tone that invites the user to further explore the website. The page itself is interactive with different pages having different audios that suit each space e.g., the harbour has faint sounds of seagulls and waves. There is also speech on the webpage as you explore the area of Capri and stumble across new makeup items that are part of the collection you are explained to by a guide what each item is. The audio combined with the soft images used on the page and the slight shimmer in the air make the experience enjoyable and makes you want to explore all possible areas to hear new audios.</p>

		<h2>IL: Task 2</h2>
		<p>The first audio I could use a background noise to my page as it sparks nostalgia to older louder keyboards more prominent at the time club penguin was most active. The second sounds I could use as a joke to mention how far computers have come and how grateful we can be that they no longer make horrific noises such as this one. Although these two sounds are suitable for my website, for my desired user experience would rather the page be silent so the reader could take in the information without loud distractions.

<p>One of the tools I found interesting on audacity was the pan tool. This created the effect of the audio coming from one ear to another. This would be a really useful tool for an interactive website where the user would need to delve into the page, it would give more of an immersive experience.</p>

<p>I also added an echo feature which gave made the sound feature more than one person typing in a keyboard. </p>
