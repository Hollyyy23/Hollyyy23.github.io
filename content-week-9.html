		<p>Website: <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-24">EA Sports new dynamic to FC brand </a></p>

		<p>The website used small graphics of video clips that showcased new features on 		their new release pack. These visual aids make the pack seem more appealing and have 		really dramatic action shots. They have been sued for the purpose and intent of 		retention on the webpage. This houses many benefits such as having a more motion 		friendly webpage that doesnâ€™t just sit still on a screen. The video are about 20 		seconds in length and loop when complete. I found myself watching them many times due 		the satisfying action shots. The videos are used with loud text colours and lots of 		use of bold heading. The page overall is very exciting. This is a topic however that 		has no interest to me, yet I found myself exploring the page due to the use of 			multimedia. This helped me to understand just how effected multimedia can be when 		used correctly.</p>
