		<h2>IL: Task 1</h2>
		<p>My websites audience:</p>
		<p>does the focus of your topic lend itself to particular audiences? What makes you 		think this?</p>
		<ul> 
		<li>My topic appeals to the audience of those who have previously played club penguin 		as well as those who have a interest in digital literacy, I think this due to the 		specific nature of my topic and its narrow scope of information relevancy </li> </ul>
		
		<p>Whether you want to focus on a broad or narrow audience?</p>
		<ul> 
		<li>A more niche audience is more suited for tailoring my topic towards its target 		audience.</li> </ul>
		
		<p>Whether the audience is likely to have pre-existing expectations about the topic?		</p>
		<ul> 
		<li>Yes, I believe that those who have previously played club penguin will in fact 		know it contains tools to build digital literacy skills.</li> </ul>

		<p>What types of audience do you have regular access to in order to facilitate user 		testing?</p>
		<ul> 
		<li>My self, as well as friends who used to play club penguin and a have a simple 		grasp of what digital literacy is.</li> </ul>

		<h2>IL: Task 3</h2>
		<P>Writing User Stories</P>
		<P>As a web developer, Jessica wants to research various MMO games online both past 		and present, so she can begin to develop her own idea. Jessica will know she has 		achieved her goal when she develops her basic understanding of digital literacy to a 		more complex level, understanding why previously popular MMO’s no longer exist, and 		what makes the ones around today so popular.</P>

		<h2>IL: Task 4</h2>
		<P>My audience choice is, although narrow, strong and will help me direct the design 		of my website. I want to incorporate similar colour and design patterns sued for the 		club penguin website to make it create a spark of nostalgia for those visiting the 		sit with past experiences of club penguin to bring in that initial interest, but they 		will come out of my website gaining an understanding of how they have previously 		experienced digital literacy in their youth.</P>

		<h2>LAB: Task 1</h2>
		<p>Webpage 1: Yale School of Art <br>
		The web page fails to address its topic with flawed use of the principles of design 		thinking. It has poor navigation with many things duplicating on the web page making 		the structure confusing and awkward to read. I understand the appeal of wanting to 		reach their audience with quirky out there web design but this is just a mess of 		colour and shape at an attempt to be artistic on the web. The horizontal gradient 		text boxes in their puke yellow colour is particularly painful. The calendar feature 		is layed out nice but it’s outsourced from another site and so although nice stands 		out like a sore thumb against the chaos. There is sue of different kinds of 			multimedia but it’s just so messy that it can even be hard to know what’s an image 		and what’s a text box. The background image of the page is not plain in colour and is 		its own image with makes reading other texts hard when there text travelling down the 		page with you in the background on the background image. I can tell the project is 		aimed at the artistic students of yale and the information is relevant to them but I 		think the design is almost poking fun at them. The lack of symmetry is also 			really off putting./p>

		<p>Webpage 2: The White House <br> 
		This web page effectively addresses their relevant topics with a sleek and easy to 		navigate web design. It offers easy opportunities to learn information without 			struggling to understand text or images on the page. It contracts strongly with the 		previously explored web page. The colours all work well together and don’t spark any 		particularly strong or even negative emotions. The font on the page is particularly 		nice as its smart and makes you take the page seriously compared to the use of a 		curlier and wilder font. The page is designed well for those visiting it. The overall 		layout of the page is satisfying to look at and explore.</p>

		<h2>LAB: Task 2</h2>
		<p>I would ignore any of the design used on the yale site and wouldn’t want to 			replicate their mistakes on my own page as my audience would dislike it just as much 		as I would. The white house however has a nice layout using boxes to separate 			text and give it a more exciting format than just paragraphs down a large page. </p>
