		<h1>Why Club Penguin was a great digital literacy tool for children, and why itâ€™s now obsolete.</h1>
		<h2>MAD(A) Project Homepage</h2>

		<p>My topic is about the popular MMO game Club Penguin, that existed from 2005-2017, and how it provided great digital literacy skills for younger users of the web. It will explore what club penguin was, how it was an example of  a digital literacy tool, and why it no longer exists in our web today.</p>
