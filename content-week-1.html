		<h2>IL: Task 1</h2>
		<p>Why Club Penguin was a great digital literacy tool for children, and why it’s now obsolete. <br> </p>

<p> Possible exploration: <br>
-importance of digital literacy <br>
-evolution of the web <br>
-education in online MMO’s <br>
-add free, safe user experience <br> </p>

<p> Who would benefit from engaging with this topic? <br>
-anyone interested on what digital literacy is <br>
-anyone interested in current day MMO’s <br>
-anyone who previously played and club penguin <br>
-anyone interested on how the web has evolved <br> </p>

<p> Are they new to the topic but eager to learn? <br>
-I think they would be familiar with either club penguin or similar MMO’s to spark an initial interest to the topic <br>
-A general interest in digital literacy is also important </p>

<p> Will you have to persuade them that this is worth learning? <br>
-No, I think the audience will be attracted due to their genuine interest and nostalgia, and so will engage from the get-go with the topic <p/>

<p> How would the topic benefit them? <br>
-They would learn what digital literacy is and why its important <br>
-It would help to educate them on why the games they previously enjoyed don’t exist and will also include information about the MMO’s <br>

		<h2>IL: Task 3</h2>
		<p>Reflect and make notes on:</p>
		<p>Whether the search term returned useful and appropriate resources: <br> 
		Managed to find various articles relating exactly to my topic as well as many 			citations from said article that’s led me to further develop what I actually want to 		talk about within my topic
		</p>

		<p>Why certain resource, particularly the irrelevant ones, were returned from your 		query:<br> 
		Many of the resources I came across become to grow irrelevant due to being about 		digital literacy on a much broader scale and become less and less specific as my 		search went on
		</p>

		<p>Whether any further refinement is needed, and then the results of these 			alterations:<br> 
		Had to introduce searching for digital literacy specifically within education as well 		as online social situations within lower education, gave me much stronger and 			relevant results.
